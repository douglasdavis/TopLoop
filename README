TopLoop RootCore package

TopLoop is a small library inspired by the ASG EventLoop
package. TopLoop is built specifically for analyzing Top group ntuples
output by the TopAnalysis top-xoad program.

To use the TopLoop library in a setup for the 2.6.X AnalysisTop
series, clone this git repository into your sources area.

To use the TopLoop library in a setup for the 2.4.X AnalysisTop
series, clone this git repository into your RootCore area and follow
the standard compilation procedure:

$ rc find_packages
$ rc compile

TopLoop delivers a base algorithm class, a job runner, a file manager,
and a small event data model. The algorithm has the following
structure:

- init(): run at the beginning of the job
- setupOutput(): run immediately following init()
- execute(): run on each iteration of the event set
- finish(): run after the completion of all execute() calls

Within the AIDA group, we have a mature algorithm built on top of the
TopLoop framework called AIDALoop.
